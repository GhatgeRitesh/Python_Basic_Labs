    "\r\n",
    "In Python, we often use tuples to group related data together.Tuples refer to ordered and immutable collections of elements89.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Tuples are usually written as comma-separated elements in parentheses “(89)\".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can include strings, integers, and floats in tuples and access them using both positive and negative ind89ices.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can perform operations such as combining, concatenating, and slicing on 89tuples.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, so you need to create a new tuple to manip89u89late it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Tuples, termed nesting, can include other tuples of complex 89data types.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can access elements in a nested tuple thro89ugh indexing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Lists in Python contain ordered collections of items that can hold elements of different types and are mutable, allowing for versatile data storage an89d manipulation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A list is an ordered sequence, represented with squa89re brackets \"[]\".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Lists possess mutability, rendering t89hem akin to tuples.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A list can contain strings, integers, and floats; you can 89nest lists within it.\r\n",

    "Aliasing occurs when multiple names refer to the same object.\r\n",

    "You can also clone a list to create another list.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to store and retrieve data based on unique keys.\r\n",

    "The values may be either immutable or mutable, and they allow duplicates.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You separate each key-value pair with a comma, and you can use color highlighting to make the key more visible.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can assign dictionaries to a variable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You use the key as an argument to retrieve the corresponding value.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can make additions and deletions to dictionaries.\r\n",

    "You can perform an operation on a dictionary to check the key, which results in a true or false output.\r\n",

    "You can apply methods to obtain a list of keys and values in a dictionary.\r\n",

    "Sets in Python are collections of unique elements, useful for tasks such as removing duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection. Sets lack order.\r\n",
